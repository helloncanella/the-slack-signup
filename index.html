        <h1>The Slack's Subscription Method</h1>

        <p>To offer a delightful user experience is fundamental to engage potential consumers. So, don't bother them with a complicated
            sign up is an excellent starting point.
        </p>
        <p>Following this principle, to require just one click in a social button is a great approach.
        </p>
        <p>Sometimes, however, the nature of a service demands more inputs and steps. As an example, it is possible to cite Slack, a successful
            team collaboration tool.
        </p>
        <p>In the beginning, the process requires the e-mail of the user.
        </p>

        <p>The use of visual metaphor in the sidebar is an elegant strategy to explain what the app does. At the same time,
            the proper use of the negative space and the typography conveys the idea of simplicity.
        </p>
        <p>For the sake of authentication, a token is sent to the informed email and required during this step.
        </p>

        <p>The one-click method would replace the two previous steps, easing the process. However, to link a social network
            may expose the internal communication of the company, what makes this approach inappropriate.
        </p>
        <p>The next screen requires a password.
        </p>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/NB1Dcep.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NB1Dcep.png" alt=""/></a>
        <p>The absence of a confirmation field reveals the designer's search for simplicity. The recuperation of the password,
            if necessary, can be easily done in the future.
        </p>
        <p>Feedback about the degree of security of the password is provided. In a certain extent, it educates the user about
            password vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>Some information about the team is required now.
        </p>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1fqhvu7.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1fqhvu7.png" alt=""/></a>
        <p>Regarding the user experience, this step doesn't aggregate any value.
        </p>
        <p>Now, the company name is required,
        </p>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8OMTYYv.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8OMTYYv.png" alt=""/></a>
        <p>In this stage, the URL of the channel is chosen.
        </p>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fGhrdyb.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fGhrdyb.png" alt=""/></a>
        <p>In the end, the user can make invitations or just skip this step, what reduces the bureaucracy of the subscription.
        </p>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/aOq2ynV.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aOq2ynV.png" alt="" class="img-invitation"/></a>
        <p>In some degree, the Slack's subscription is long. Nevertheless, the nature of its service reveals this necessity.
        </p>
        <p>At the same time, the careful employment of design strategies, such as the application of visual metaphor and limited
            usage of input fields by each step, exposes the Slack's intention to make the registration as simple as possible.
        </p>
        <p>For all the reasons presented above, I love Slack sign up approach.
